# HealthTech Core

## Overview

**HealthTech Core** is a comprehensive healthcare management system designed to handle real-world patient data workflows, clinical decision support, and regulatory compliance. This is a living hospital backend and dashboard that continuously evolves to meet the complex demands of modern healthcare technology.

## Mental Model

> "A living hospital backend + dashboard that never stops evolving."

This system simulates a production healthcare environment where patient data flows seamlessly through multiple stages, healthcare providers make critical decisions with intelligent support, and administrators ensure system integrity and compliance.

## Real-Life Scenario

### Patient Journey

When a patient walks into a clinic (or submits data online), their information flows through:

1. **Intake** - Initial data collection and entry
2. **Validation** - Data quality checks and verification
3. **Clinical Workflow** - Processing through medical protocols
4. **Analytics** - Risk assessment and pattern analysis
5. **Audit Logs** - Complete traceability for compliance

### Doctor Experience

When a doctor logs in, they can:

- **View Patient History** - Access comprehensive medical records
- **See Risk Flags** - Identify potential health concerns automatically
- **Receive Decision Support** - Get AI-powered clinical recommendations

### Admin Capabilities

Administrators can:

- **Monitor System Health** - Track performance and availability
- **View Audit Trails** - Ensure complete accountability
- **Ensure Compliance** - Maintain regulatory standards (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)

## What This Teaches

This project provides hands-on experience with:

- **Real-world Data Modeling** - Complex healthcare data structures and relationships
- **Permissions & Roles** - Multi-level access control and security
- **Long-lived Data Systems** - Building systems that evolve over years
- **Regulatory-style Thinking** - Critical for healthcare (HIPAA, FDA, etc.)

## Technical Stack

This project is part of my multi-year mastery program covering:

- **JavaScript** - Frontend and Node.js backend
- **Go** - High-performance services
- **Python** - Data processing and analytics
- **Rust** - Systems-level components
- **DevOps & Cloud** - Infrastructure and deployment

## Current Status

**Week 1**: Project skeleton and setup.

## Planned Evolution

This system will grow iteratively over time, incorporating:

- Advanced clinical decision support algorithms
- Real-time analytics and reporting
- Enhanced security and compliance features
- Integration with medical devices and EHR systems
- Scalable architecture patterns

## Architecture

The system is designed to handle:

- **High Availability** - 24/7 operation critical for healthcare
- **Data Integrity** - Immutable audit logs and versioning
- **Security** - End-to-end encryption and access controls
- **Scalability** - Handle growing patient volumes
- **Compliance** - Built-in regulatory adherence
